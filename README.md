# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Smiling Face Generation

## Problem Statement

Generating realistic and expressive facial images is a challenging task in computer vision. This project aims to generate high-quality facial images with a smiling expression using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The problem is to create a GAN model that can produce convincing and diverse smiling faces.

## Solution

The solution involves training a GAN model, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, on a dataset of facial images. The generator generates fake images, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images. Through adversarial training, the generator learns to produce realistic smiling faces.
